# Plan for Jest vs Vitest Documentation

## Document Structure

1. Introduction

   - Purpose of the document
   - Overview of the Jest to Vitest migration project

2. Key Differences

   - Syntax differences
   - API differences
   - Mock implementation differences
   - Configuration differences
   - Performance considerations

3. Migration Patterns

   - Common patterns used in this project
   - Specific examples from the codebase
   - Before/after comparisons

4. Best Practices

   - Recommended approaches for new tests
   - Compatibility considerations
   - Common pitfalls to avoid

5. References
   - Vitest documentation links
   - Jest-to-Vitest migration guides
   - Project-specific resources

## Implementation Approach

1. **Analyze the Migration Work**

   - Review all completed migrations in the project
   - Identify common patterns and challenges
   - Document specific differences encountered

2. **Create a Comprehensive Document**

   - Write clear, concise documentation
   - Include code examples from our own codebase
   - Highlight the patterns that worked best

3. **Focus on Project-Specific Patterns**

   - Document the resetTestMocks function usage
   - Explain the vitest-imports.js helper
   - Show how to handle Chrome API mocking

4. **Include Troubleshooting Information**
   - Common errors during migration
   - Solutions for specific edge cases (like performance API issues)
   - Debugging tips

## Output Format

Create a Markdown document named `JEST-VITEST-MIGRATION.md` in the project root directory, following the structure above and focusing on the specific patterns used in this project.
