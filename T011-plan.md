# T011 Plan: Ensure Repository Default Branch is Master

## Context
This task is part of the DevOps/CI improvements (cr-11, Step 1) to ensure consistent branch naming and workflow configurations.

## Analysis
Based on the output of `git branch -a`, it appears that:
1. The repository has a local `master` branch
2. The remote repository has `master` as its default branch (`remotes/origin/HEAD -> origin/master`)
3. The current branch is `refactor-modularize`

The task asks us to verify and set the default branch to `master`. Since the remote already shows `origin/HEAD -> origin/master`, it appears that the default branch is already set to `master`.

## Action Steps
1. Verify that the remote repository's default branch is indeed `master` by confirming the remote HEAD reference
2. If needed, update the default branch to `master` in the Git hosting platform settings

## Verification
- We've already verified that `remotes/origin/HEAD -> origin/master`, indicating that `master` is the default branch
- No changes are needed as the repository already has `master` set as the default branch

## Next Steps
Mark the ticket as complete in TODO.md, as the requirement is already met:
1. Default branch is already `master`
