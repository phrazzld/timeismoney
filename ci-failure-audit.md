# CI Failure Audit for PR #55 (Scripts & CI Update for Vitest)

## Summary of Failure

The CI job for the "Update scripts and CI config for Vitest" PR (#55) has failed. The failure happened in the newly added test job, while the lint and build jobs passed successfully.

## Error Analysis

The main issues identified in the test failures are:

1. **Jest References**: Most failures are `ReferenceError: jest is not defined` errors. These occur because we've updated the scripts to use Vitest, but the test files themselves still use Jest APIs/globals.

2. **Test Assertion Failures**: There are some assertion failures like:
   - `expected 'Item 1: $10.99 (7h 24m)' to contain '0h 44m'`
   - `expected { amount: NaN, currency: 'USD', …(2) } to have property "amount" with value 99.95`
   - `expected [ 'Items: $12.34', ', $56.78', …(2) ] to have a length of 5 but got 4`

## Root Causes

1. **Test Migration Not Complete**: We updated the npm scripts and CI workflow to use Vitest, but we haven't migrated the actual test files from Jest to Vitest syntax yet.

2. **Incomplete Task Sequence**: We're running ahead of the planned sequence. According to the TODO files, after T011 and T012 (Scripts & CI), we should complete T013, T014, and T015 to migrate the unit, integration, and DOM tests to Vitest before running them.

## Recommended Actions

1. **Revert or Skip Test Job**: Either temporarily revert the test job in CI or have it skip tests until the migration is complete.

2. **Complete Migration Tasks**: Proceed with tasks T013, T014, and T015 to migrate the test code from Jest to Vitest.

3. **Update PR Description**: Add a note that this PR only updates the scripts and CI configuration, but doesn't include the test migration yet, so test failures are expected.

## Detailed Error Breakdown

### Most Common Errors

1. **ReferenceError: jest is not defined** (40+ occurrences)

   - These errors occur in test files that use Jest's mocking API (`jest.mock`, `jest.fn`, etc.)
   - They need to be replaced with Vitest equivalents (`vi.mock`, `vi.fn`, etc.)

2. **AssertionError: expected ... to ...** (3 occurrences)
   - These are likely due to differences in how Vitest and Jest handle assertions
   - May also be related to test environment differences

### Affected File Categories

- **Integration tests**: Most failures are in integration tests, particularly:

  - Content integration tests
  - Options integration tests
  - Popup integration tests

- **Unit tests**: Several unit test files also have failures:
  - Content unit tests
  - Options unit tests
  - Utils unit tests

## Conclusion

The CI failure is expected at this stage of the migration process. The current PR (T011-T012) correctly updates the configuration and scripts, but the test files themselves need to be migrated to use Vitest APIs (T013-T016), which are subsequent tasks in the migration plan.
