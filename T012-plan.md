# T012 Plan: Update CI Workflow Triggers to Master Branch

## Context
This task is part of the DevOps/CI improvements (cr-11, Step 2) to ensure CI only runs for the master branch.

## Analysis
After examining the CI workflow file at `.github/workflows/ci.yml`, I found that it's already correctly configured to run only for the master branch:

```yaml
on:
  push:
    branches: [ master ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ master ]
```

This configuration means that the CI workflow will only trigger on:
1. Push events to the master branch
2. Pull request events targeting the master branch

No other branches will trigger the CI workflow, which matches exactly what the ticket requires.

## Action Required
No action is needed as the CI workflow is already correctly configured to run only for the master branch.

## Verification
The configuration in `.github/workflows/ci.yml` already meets the requirements specified in the ticket:
- Push events trigger CI only for the master branch
- Pull request events trigger CI only when targeting the master branch 

## Next Steps
Mark the ticket as complete in TODO.md, as the acceptance criteria are already met:
1. CI only runs for the master branch
