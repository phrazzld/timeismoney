# TASK-003 Findings: Current Price Detection Behavior

## Summary

Created comprehensive tests to document current price detection behavior. The tests reveal both working functionality and significant limitations.

## Key Discoveries

### 1. Working Features

- Basic heuristic detection (`mightContainPrice`) works for currency symbols
- Pattern generation works but returns RegExp objects, not strings
- Text with currency symbols is generally detected as potentially containing prices
- European format detection works for EUR currency code
- Multiple prices in text can be found with global pattern matching

### 2. Major Limitations

#### Pattern Matching Issues

- Direct pattern matching on individual prices often fails
- The patterns generated don't always match the expected price formats
- Zero prices ($0, $0.00) fail pattern matching
- Large numbers with comma thousands ($2,500,000) fail

#### Reverse Search Mode

- Reverse search for annotated prices doesn't work as expected
- The TIME_ANNOTATION_PATTERN is used but doesn't match expected formats

#### Format Detection

- `findPrices` returns RegExp objects for `thousands` and `decimal`, not strings
- This differs from what tests expected (strings like ',' vs RegExp /,/g)

#### Real-World Failures (as documented)

- Cdiscount "449â‚¬ 00" split format - only partially detected
- Amazon aria-label attributes - completely missed (text-only detection)
- Amazon split components - difficult to extract cleanly
- Contextual prices - inconsistent detection
- DOM-based prices - no support for attribute extraction

### 3. Special Cases

- Found hardcoded special case in `findPrices` for specific test text
- This suggests previous attempts to make tests pass without fixing underlying issues

## Test Files Created

1. **priceFinder.current-behavior.vitest.test.js**

   - Documents expected working behavior
   - 8 of 16 tests fail, revealing gaps between expected and actual behavior

2. **priceFinder.realworld-failures.vitest.test.js**

   - Documents known failures with real HTML examples
   - Most tests pass as they expect failures
   - 2 tests fail where we expected the current system to work

3. **priceFinder.dom-scenarios.vitest.test.js**
   - Documents need for DOM-aware extraction
   - Shows limitations of text-only approach
   - Provides test cases for future DOM-based implementation

## Implications for Next Tasks

1. **Pattern Generation**: Need to fix pattern generation to match expected formats
2. **DOM Analysis**: Critical need for DOM-aware extraction (TASK-004)
3. **Attribute Extraction**: Must support aria-label, data-\* attributes
4. **Split Components**: Need strategy for assembling prices from multiple elements
5. **Site-Specific Handlers**: Essential for major e-commerce sites

## Recommendations

1. Fix immediate issues with pattern matching
2. Prioritize DOM analysis implementation
3. Remove hardcoded test cases from production code
4. Implement proper attribute extraction
5. Create site-specific handlers for known problematic sites

## Test Coverage

The tests now provide:

- Baseline documentation of current behavior
- Clear failing cases that need fixes
- DOM-based scenarios for future implementation
- Real-world examples from actual e-commerce sites

This comprehensive test suite will guide the implementation of enhanced price detection in subsequent tasks.
