# T033 Plan: Allow Injecting Mock MutationObserver for Tests

## Overview
This task involves refactoring the `observeDomChanges` function in the `domScanner.js` module to allow for dependency injection of a MutationObserver constructor or instance. The goal is to improve testability by making it possible to inject a mock implementation of MutationObserver during tests.

## Approach

1. Modify the `observeDomChanges` function to accept an optional MutationObserver parameter
2. Implement a default that uses the global MutationObserver when not provided
3. Update any necessary documentation and types
4. Ensure code is backward compatible with existing usage

## Implementation Steps

1. Examine the current implementation of `observeDomChanges` in `domScanner.js`
2. Add a new parameter to the function to allow passing in a custom MutationObserver constructor
3. Update the internal logic to use the provided constructor if available, otherwise fall back to the global MutationObserver
4. Update the JSDoc to document the new parameter
5. Test backward compatibility to ensure existing code still works as expected
6. Add a simple usage example to demonstrate how to inject a mock MutationObserver in tests

## Benefits

This change will improve testability by:
- Making it possible to test DOM observation logic without relying on the actual browser MutationObserver
- Allowing test code to simulate DOM mutations in a controlled manner
- Enabling verification of observer configuration and callback behavior
- Supporting more comprehensive unit tests with better isolation from browser APIs
