# T001 Plan: Sanitize User Inputs Before Validation and Saving

## Overview
Implement input sanitization for all user inputs in the options form to prevent XSS attacks and other injection vulnerabilities.

## Current State Analysis
Let's examine the current implementation of `formHandler.js` to understand:
1. Which user inputs need sanitization
2. The current validation logic
3. Where to insert sanitization (before validation)

## Implementation Plan

### 1. Create Sanitization Functions
- Implement a general-purpose `sanitizeInput` function to handle common sanitization tasks
- Create specific sanitization functions for each input type (if needed)
- Use appropriate sanitization techniques:
  - HTML entity escaping for text inputs
  - Strict whitelisting for numeric inputs and special characters

### 2. Update Form Handler Logic
- Apply sanitization to all user inputs before validation:
  - `currencySymbol`: Sanitize to prevent XSS in symbol display
  - `amount`: Ensure only valid numeric characters
  - `debounceInterval`: Ensure only valid numeric characters
  - Any other user-provided inputs

### 3. Add Tests
- Create test cases to verify that malicious inputs are properly sanitized
- Attempt common XSS payloads and ensure they're neutralized

## Approach Details
1. For currency symbols and codes: Use a whitelist approach that only allows valid characters
2. For numeric inputs: Ensure inputs are numeric and within reasonable bounds
3. Apply sanitization early in the input processing flow, before validation and storage

## Testing Strategy
- Unit tests for each sanitization function with various inputs
- Integration tests that verify the full form handling process with sanitization
- Specific tests for known XSS vectors and edge cases
