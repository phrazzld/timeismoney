# Task Description

## Issue Details

**Issue #113 - Automated Dependency Security Scanning**
URL: https://github.com/phrazzld/timeismoney/issues/113

## Overview

Implement comprehensive automated dependency vulnerability scanning with CI integration and automated security update management. Currently no automated scanning for dependency vulnerabilities exists, creating security risks for users and legal compliance issues.

## Requirements

### Core Requirements

- Integrate vulnerability scanning tools (npm audit, Snyk, or GitHub Security Advisories)
- Configure CI pipeline to fail on critical/high severity vulnerabilities
- Implement automated PR creation for security dependency updates
- Create security monitoring dashboard for ongoing vulnerability tracking
- Establish vulnerability response procedures and SLAs
- Document security escalation processes
- Regular security audit schedule

### Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Vulnerability scanning integrated into CI pipeline
- [ ] Build fails on critical/high severity vulnerabilities
- [ ] Automated security update PRs configured
- [ ] Security monitoring dashboard created
- [ ] Vulnerability response procedures documented
- [ ] Security escalation workflows established
- [ ] Regular security audit schedule implemented

## Technical Context

### Current Project Setup

- **Package Manager**: pnpm (enforced via preinstall script)
- **Node.js Version**: >=20.0.0 (enforced)
- **Testing Framework**: Vitest (migrated from Jest)
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions
- **Linting**: ESLint + Prettier
- **Build Tool**: esbuild for extension bundling
- **Dependencies**: Chrome Extension APIs, @microsoft/recognizers-text-suite, money.js

### Current CI Pipeline Structure

Located in `.github/workflows/`, currently includes:

- Node.js version validation
- Dependency installation with pnpm
- Linting and formatting checks
- Test execution with Vitest
- Build verification

### Security Context

- Chrome Extension with Manifest V3
- Handles user financial data (currency conversions)
- Operates on external websites (content script injection)
- Stores user preferences locally
- No current automated vulnerability scanning

## Related Issues

- **#107** - Comprehensive Security Audit (Critical Priority) - This task provides foundation
- **#109** - Data Privacy Compliance Framework (High Priority) - Security scanning supports compliance
- **#110** - Real-Time Error Monitoring (High Priority) - Complementary monitoring infrastructure

## Project Constraints

### Development Philosophy Alignment

- **Simplicity First**: Choose simple, effective scanning tools over complex solutions
- **Modularity**: Integration should be modular and not tightly coupled
- **Testability**: Scanning infrastructure should be testable
- **Automation**: Fully automated with minimal manual intervention required
- **Security**: Foundational requirement - no compromises on security standards

### Technical Constraints

- Must work with pnpm package manager
- Must integrate with existing GitHub Actions CI
- Must support Node.js >=20.0.0
- Must handle Chrome extension specific dependencies
- Should not significantly impact CI pipeline performance
- Must provide clear, actionable feedback to developers

### Business Constraints

- High priority task requiring rapid implementation
- Foundation for other security initiatives
- Compliance requirement for user trust and legal obligations
- Must establish security practices for team adoption
