# Task Plan: Fix formHandler.storage.integration.test.js by adding proper Vitest imports

## Task Description

Add proper Vitest imports to the `formHandler.storage.integration.test.js` file to support the migration from Jest to Vitest. This is a focused task to ensure the integration test properly uses the Vitest import pattern with our newly created import helper.

## Current Problem

The `formHandler.storage.integration.test.js` file likely relies on Jest globals and does not have explicit imports for Vitest testing functions. This causes test failures when running with Vitest, as the global Jest functions are not available in the Vitest environment.

## Approach

1. Examine the current `formHandler.storage.integration.test.js` file to understand its structure
2. Add the appropriate Vitest imports using our newly created `vitest-imports.js` helper
3. Ensure the imports include all required testing functions used in the file
4. Test the changes by running the file directly with Vitest

## Implementation Steps

1. Locate and read the `formHandler.storage.integration.test.js` file
2. Determine all testing functions used in the file that need imports (describe, it, expect, beforeEach, afterEach, etc.)
3. Add import statement at the top of the file using the new Vitest import helper
4. Run the test to see if it resolves the import issues
5. Fix any additional issues that arise during testing

## Success Criteria

- The test file has proper imports from the Vitest import helper
- The test can run without errors related to missing Jest globals
- The approach follows the pattern documented in the `VITEST-IMPORT-HELPER.md` file

## Note

This task only focuses on adding proper imports. The next task in the TODO list will address replacing Jest references with `vi` equivalents, so we don't need to make those changes in this task.
