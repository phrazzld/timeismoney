# Plan Details

## Executive Summary

The extension currently fails to detect and convert prices on various e-commerce sites like gearbest.com. This plan outlines a comprehensive approach to improve price detection reliability across diverse websites by enhancing pattern recognition, implementing fallback strategies, and adding better debugging capabilities.

## Key Implementation Areas

### Phase 1: Enhanced Pattern Recognition

- Expand pattern recognition in `priceFinder.js`
- Add flexible currency detection
- Implement DOM structure analysis
- Create site-specific pattern configurations

### Phase 2: Fallback Strategies

- Multi-pass detection (standard → relaxed → contextual)
- Element context analysis
- Parent element inspection for price indicators

### Phase 3: Testing & Validation

- Comprehensive test suite for all reported failing sites
- Visual regression tests
- Performance benchmarks
- Debug mode improvements

## Task Breakdown Requirements

- Create atomic, independent tasks
- Ensure proper dependency mapping
- Include verification steps
- Follow project task ID and formatting conventions
- Apply TDD approach where appropriate
- Consider performance implications
- Include integration testing tasks
