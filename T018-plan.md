# T018 Plan: Validate Test Suite Performance

## Classification: Simple

This task is classified as Simple because:

- It involves running existing test commands and measuring performance
- The success criteria are well-defined (measure execution time and memory usage)
- No code changes are required, just performance measurement and analysis
- The plan of action is straightforward

## Implementation Approach

1. **Establish Baseline Metrics**

   - Run Jest tests to establish baseline performance (if possible)
   - Note timing information for comparison with Vitest

2. **Measure Vitest Test Performance**

   - Run full Vitest test suite and measure execution time
   - Note memory usage if possible
   - Separately measure unit, integration, and DOM tests to identify any performance bottlenecks

3. **Identify Performance Impact Factors**

   - Analyze test execution times for different test categories
   - Identify any particularly slow tests or test suites
   - Determine if the test performance aligns with the expected improvements from the migration

4. **Document Findings**
   - Create a detailed report on test performance
   - Compare to Jest baseline if available
   - Document any performance concerns or recommendations

## Success Criteria

- Full test suite runs successfully
- Performance metrics (execution time) are measured
- Performance analysis is documented

## Implementation Plan

1. Run Jest tests for baseline (if applicable)
2. Run full Vitest test suite with timing:
   - `time npm test`
   - `npm run test:unit`
   - `npm run test:integration`
   - `npm run test:dom`
3. Run targeted tests with the `--trace` flag to identify slow tests
4. Document findings and create performance report
5. Update task with completion details
