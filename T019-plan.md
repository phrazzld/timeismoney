# T019 Plan: Update Developer Documentation for Vitest

## Classification: Simple

This task is classified as Simple because:

- It involves updating documentation files with factual information about the existing Vitest setup
- The changes are limited to a few files (README.md, CONTRIBUTING.md, CLAUDE.md, and a new TESTING_GUIDE.md)
- No code changes are required, only text updates
- The approach is straightforward

## Implementation Approach

1. **Update README.md**

   - Update brief mentions of the testing framework (Jest â†’ Vitest)
   - No major changes required since README is focused on user information

2. **Update CONTRIBUTING.md**

   - Replace Jest-specific instructions with Vitest equivalents
   - Update testing commands section
   - Update CI workflow section to mention Vitest

3. **Update CLAUDE.md**

   - Update test commands and testing information
   - Update any other test-related guidance for Claude AI

4. **Create TESTING_GUIDE.md**
   - Comprehensive guide explaining the test categorization (unit/integration/dom)
   - Document the Vitest configuration and test structure
   - Provide examples of writing tests in Vitest
   - Document mocking approach and best practices
   - Include information on test coverage requirements

## Success Criteria

- All documentation accurately reflects the current Vitest setup
- All Jest references are replaced with Vitest equivalents
- New TESTING_GUIDE.md provides clear guidance for developers

## Implementation Plan

1. Update README.md first (minimal changes)
2. Update CONTRIBUTING.md to reflect the new testing workflow
3. Update CLAUDE.md with current test commands and guidance
4. Create comprehensive TESTING_GUIDE.md
5. Verify all Jest references have been replaced
6. Update TODO-07-Documentation.md to mark the task as completed
