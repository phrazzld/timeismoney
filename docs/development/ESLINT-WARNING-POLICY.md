# ESLint Warning Management Policy

## Overview

This document establishes the policy for managing ESLint warnings in the codebase, balancing code quality enforcement with practical development workflow and CI pipeline stability.

## Current Configuration Status

- **ESLint Config**: `.eslintrc.json` with comprehensive rule set
- **Max Warnings Limit**: 60 (adjusted from 0 for CI compatibility)
- **Current Warning Count**: ~53 warnings (as of CI analysis)
- **Warning Buffer**: 7 warnings (13% headroom for minor fluctuations)

## Warning Categories & Policy

### 1. Error-Level Rules (Zero Tolerance)
These rules are configured as "error" and will fail the build:
- Security issues (`no-eval`, etc.)
- Type errors (`jsdoc/require-param-type`)
- Import/export violations (`import/no-commonjs`)
- Critical code quality (`eqeqeq`, `no-unused-vars` in production code)

**Policy**: Must be fixed immediately, no exceptions.

### 2. Warning-Level Rules (Managed Tolerance)
These rules are configured as "warn" and are included in the count:

#### 2.1 Documentation Warnings (Acceptable)
- `jsdoc/require-description`: Missing JSDoc descriptions
- `jsdoc/require-param-description`: Missing parameter descriptions  
- `jsdoc/require-returns-description`: Missing return descriptions
- `jsdoc/tag-lines`: JSDoc formatting preferences

**Rationale**: While JSDoc is valuable, requiring descriptions for every function can be overly burdensome for internal utility functions. Code should be self-documenting where possible.

**Policy**: Acceptable for internal functions. Required for public APIs.

#### 2.2 Style & Modernization Warnings (Improve When Touched)
- `prefer-const`: Use const instead of let when not reassigned
- `no-var`: Use let/const instead of var
- `no-console`: Console statements in non-script files

**Rationale**: These improve code quality but are not critical. Fixing when files are already being modified prevents introducing noise in unrelated changes.

**Policy**: Fix when working on affected files, but not required for urgent fixes.

#### 2.3 Test Pattern Warnings (Context-Specific)
- Test file configuration warnings
- Import pattern warnings in test setup
- Test-specific JSDoc relaxations

**Rationale**: Test files have different patterns and requirements than production code. Some warnings are contextually appropriate.

**Policy**: Review case-by-case. Many test patterns are acceptable.

### 3. Disabled Rules (Explicit Exceptions)
Certain rules are disabled in specific contexts via overrides:
- JSDoc requirements in test files
- Import resolution in test/script files
- Console statements in scripts directory

**Policy**: These are intentional and documented in `.eslintrc.json`.

## Warning Threshold Management

### Current Threshold: 60 warnings
- **Rationale**: Provides buffer above current ~53 warnings
- **Buffer Purpose**: Allows for minor warning fluctuations during development
- **Review Trigger**: If warnings exceed 55, review and triage

### Warning Reduction Strategy
1. **Opportunistic Fixes**: Address warnings when files are being modified for other reasons
2. **Quarterly Reviews**: Assess warning trends and consider rule adjustments
3. **New Code Standards**: All new code should introduce minimal warnings
4. **Legacy Code Tolerance**: Existing working code warnings are acceptable if fixing risks introducing bugs

## CI Integration

### CI Configuration
- **Command**: `pnpm run lint` (uses package.json max-warnings setting)
- **Threshold**: 60 warnings maximum
- **Failure Condition**: Exceeding warning limit or any error-level violations

### Developer Workflow
1. **Pre-commit**: Hooks catch error-level violations
2. **Local Development**: `npm run lint` shows all warnings
3. **CI Validation**: Ensures warning count stays within limits
4. **Warning Fixes**: Use `npm run lint:fix` for auto-fixable issues

## Monitoring & Maintenance

### Regular Reviews
- **Monthly**: Check warning trends in CI logs
- **Quarterly**: Review warning categories and rule effectiveness
- **Annually**: Assess overall policy effectiveness and adjust thresholds

### Warning Escalation
- **55+ warnings**: Review and prioritize fixes
- **Approaching 60**: Immediate attention required
- **New error patterns**: Investigate and address root causes

### Rule Adjustments
Changes to ESLint rules require:
1. Team discussion of impact
2. Documentation update
3. CI verification
4. Gradual rollout if increasing strictness

## Rationale for Current Approach

### Why Not Zero Warnings?
- **Legacy Code**: Existing working code shouldn't be destabilized for minor style issues
- **Development Velocity**: Overly strict warnings can slow development without proportional quality benefit
- **Test Patterns**: Test code has different optimization priorities than production code

### Why Not Unlimited Warnings?
- **Quality Baseline**: Some warnings indicate genuine issues
- **Trend Monitoring**: Unlimited warnings hide degradation over time
- **New Code Standards**: Clear expectations for new development

### Why This Threshold?
- **Current State**: Accommodates existing codebase reality
- **Growth Buffer**: Allows for minor fluctuations
- **Manageable Size**: 60 warnings is reviewable when needed

## Implementation Notes

This policy was established as part of resolving CI pipeline failures while maintaining code quality standards. The approach balances:
- **Immediate Needs**: Restore CI functionality
- **Quality Standards**: Maintain meaningful error detection
- **Practical Development**: Avoid blocking development on minor style issues
- **Future Improvement**: Create path for gradual warning reduction
