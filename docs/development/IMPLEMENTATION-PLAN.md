# Jest to Vitest Migration Implementation Plan

Based on the analysis of the CI failures and examination of the codebase, I've determined that the best approach is to enhance the global setup files to properly support Jest compatibility patterns. Here's my implementation plan:

## Root Cause Analysis

1. The PR has created both migrated (.vitest.test.js) and non-migrated (original .test.js) versions of test files
2. The CI is running all files matching `src/**/*.{test,spec}.js`, which includes both versions
3. The non-migrated files are failing because:
   - They expect global Jest functions that don't exist in Vitest
   - The `resetTestMocks` function is defined in the setup files but not properly exposed globally
   - There are differences in mock behavior between Jest and Vitest

## Implementation Strategy

We'll implement the "Hybrid Approach with Setup Files" from my earlier analysis, focusing on:

1. Enhancing `vitest.setup.js` to provide complete Jest compatibility
2. Ensuring `resetTestMocks` is properly globally available
3. Fixing the global imports pattern to work consistently

## Specific Changes

### 1. Update `vitest.setup.js`

This file should be the main setup file loaded by `vitest.config.js`. Key additions:

- Add a complete Jest compatibility layer
- Ensure all helper functions are properly exposed globally
- Fix the import pattern for browser APIs

### 2. Fix Test Configuration

- Update the `vitest.config.js` to properly load setup files in the right order
- Ensure globals are enabled and properly configured

### 3. Create Helper Utilities

- Update or create utility files for test helpers
- Add compatibility functions for Jest-specific patterns

## Implementation Details

Working on this PR, I'll:

1. First focus on updating the main setup file to make CI pass
2. Make minimal changes to ensure existing tests work
3. Add documentation for ongoing migration

The goal is to make the CI pass without requiring changes to all individual test files, as that would be a larger effort that can be done in follow-up PRs.
