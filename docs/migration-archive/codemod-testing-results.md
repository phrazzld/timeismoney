# Codemod Testing Results

This document summarizes the results of testing the Jest to Vitest codemod script on various sample files.

## Summary

The codemod script has been tested with different Jest patterns and options, and overall it performs well in transforming Jest code to Vitest. The script successfully handles a variety of patterns and provides useful options like performance API mocking and lifecycle hook generation.

## Test Categories and Findings

### Basic Mocks

**Test File**: `basic-mocks.test.js`

**Results**:

- ✅ Successfully transformed `jest.fn()`, `jest.spyOn()`, etc. to `vi` equivalents
- ✅ Added proper imports from vitest-imports.js
- ✅ Added `resetTestMocks` import and usage in beforeEach
- ✅ Correctly preserved test assertions and structure

### Timer Functions

**Test File**: `timer-functions.test.js`

**Results**:

- ✅ Successfully transformed `jest.useFakeTimers()`, `jest.advanceTimersByTime()`, etc.
- ✅ Correctly maintained beforeEach/afterEach hooks
- ✅ Properly handled runAllTimers and runOnlyPendingTimers
- ✅ Added the necessary imports

### Performance API Mocking

**Test File**: `performance-api.test.js`

**Results**:

- ✅ Successfully added Performance API mock implementation when using the `--perf-mocks` flag
- ✅ Added proper setup in beforeEach and teardown in afterEach hooks
- ✅ Included common performance measure patterns in the mock implementation
- ✅ Preserved existing performance testing logic

### Complex Mocks

**Test File**: `complex-mocks.test.js`

**Results**:

- ✅ Successfully transformed `jest.mock()` calls with factory functions
- ✅ Handled complex mock implementations correctly
- ✅ Placed the mock declarations in the correct order
- ✅ Maintained implementation details and logic

### Mixed Patterns

**Test File**: `mixed-patterns.test.js`

**Results**:

- ✅ Transformed Jest patterns while preserving existing Vitest patterns
- ⚠️ Generated duplicate imports for Vitest functions that were already imported
- ✅ Successfully transformed jest globals to vi equivalents

## Option Testing

The following options were tested and found to work as expected:

1. **--dry-run**: Successfully previewed transformations without modifying files
2. **--backup**: Created backup files (.bak) before transformation
3. **--perf-mocks**: Added performance API mocks to files using performance measurements
4. **--add-hooks**: Added appropriate lifecycle hooks for test cleanup

## Recommendations

1. **Improve Import Deduplication**: The codemod should check for existing imports to avoid duplication, particularly in files with mixed patterns.

2. **Consider Script Usage in Batch Mode**: The script performs well on individual files and is ready for use in batch migration. Start with simpler test categories first (unit tests).

3. **Add Validation for Import Paths**: In some cases, import paths might need adjustment based on the project structure. Consider adding a validation step for import paths.

4. **Performance API Detection**: The performance API detection works well, but consider enhancing the detection to identify files that use performance APIs indirectly.

## Conclusion

The enhanced codemod script is ready for batch migration. It successfully handles the most common Jest patterns and provides flexible options for different test types. The migration approach outlined in the accelerated plan should be effective with this script.

Next steps:

1. Mark this task as completed in TODO-ACCELERATED.md
2. Proceed with the first batch migration of unit tests
