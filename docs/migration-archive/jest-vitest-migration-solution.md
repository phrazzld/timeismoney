# Jest to Vitest Migration: Finding an Elegant Solution

## Context

We are working on a Chrome extension called "TimeIsMoney" that needs to migrate from Jest to Vitest for testing. Our TODO.md file has identified nearly 100 individual tasks to complete the migration, including:

1. Migrating unmigrated test files using a codemod script
2. Cleaning up partially migrated files
3. Standardizing testing patterns
4. Final validation and cleanup

The current approach is very incremental, tackling one file at a time. We're looking for a more elegant, efficient solution to "cut the Gordian knot" and accelerate this migration.

## Current Status

- Total test files: 104
- Fully migrated: 1 (0.96%)
- Partially migrated: 71 (68.27%)
- Not migrated: 30 (28.85%)
- Unknown status: 2

We have a working codemod script for basic conversion, but still need manual intervention to fix specific issues after applying it.

## Challenges

1. The migration is time-consuming with so many individual files
2. Some test files have specific issues that aren't handled by the codemod
3. We need to ensure consistency across all migrated files
4. There are different test categories (unit, integration, DOM) with different requirements
5. We need to maintain test coverage throughout the migration

## Questions

1. What more elegant, holistic approaches could we use to accelerate this migration?
2. Can we develop a more comprehensive automation strategy instead of the file-by-file approach?
3. Are there any common patterns across files that could be addressed with a unified solution?
4. Is there a way to better organize or batch the remaining work?
5. What best practices from other Jest to Vitest migrations could we apply?

Please provide a strategic plan with specific steps, tools or scripts we should develop, and an implementation approach that would significantly reduce the manual effort required.
