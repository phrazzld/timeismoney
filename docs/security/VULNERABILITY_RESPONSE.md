# Vulnerability Response Procedures

This document outlines the procedures for responding to security vulnerabilities in the TimeIsMoney Chrome extension project.

## Overview

Our security response framework is built around automated detection, structured assessment, and timely remediation of vulnerabilities in both dependencies and application code. The system integrates with our CI pipeline to provide continuous security monitoring while maintaining development velocity.

## Vulnerability Classification

### Severity Levels

We use the CVSS (Common Vulnerability Scoring System) framework to classify vulnerabilities:

| Severity | CVSS Score | Description | CI Impact | Response SLA |
|----------|------------|-------------|-----------|--------------|
| **Critical** | 9.0-10.0 | Immediate threat, remotely exploitable without authentication | ðŸ”´ **Blocks CI** | **< 4 hours** |
| **High** | 7.0-8.9 | Significant impact, likely exploitable with minimal conditions | ðŸ”´ **Blocks CI** | **< 24 hours** |
| **Medium** | 4.0-6.9 | Moderate impact, some conditions required for exploitation | ðŸŸ¡ **Warning only** | **< 7 days** |
| **Low** | 0.1-3.9 | Minimal impact, difficult to exploit or requires specific conditions | ðŸŸ¢ **Tracked only** | **< 30 days** |

### Vulnerability Types

Our system categorizes vulnerabilities into the following types:

- **Dependency Vulnerabilities**: Issues in npm packages and third-party libraries
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)**: Code injection vulnerabilities in web contexts
- **Injection Attacks**: SQL, Command, or other injection vulnerabilities
- **Authentication/Authorization**: Access control and privilege escalation issues
- **Data Exposure/Privacy**: Unauthorized data access or privacy violations
- **Denial of Service (DoS)**: Availability impact vulnerabilities

## Response Procedures

### Immediate Response (Critical & High Severity)

#### Step 1: Incident Acknowledgment (Target: 1 hour)
1. **Automatic Detection**: CI pipeline failure triggers immediate notification
2. **Manual Reporting**: Security team acknowledges GitHub issue within 1 hour
3. **Initial Assessment**: Confirm vulnerability scope and impact
4. **Stakeholder Notification**: Alert relevant team members and management

#### Step 2: Impact Assessment (Target: 4 hours for Critical, 24 hours for High)
1. **Technical Analysis**:
   - Confirm vulnerability existence and reproducibility
   - Assess actual vs. potential impact on users and systems
   - Determine exploitation difficulty and attack vectors
   - Evaluate data exposure risks

2. **Business Impact Evaluation**:
   - User base affected (number and type of users)
   - Regulatory compliance implications
   - Reputation and trust impact
   - Financial exposure

#### Step 3: Immediate Containment (Target: Same as assessment)
1. **CI Pipeline**: Automatic blocking prevents vulnerable code deployment
2. **Dependency Updates**: Prioritize security patches and version updates
3. **Allowlist Consideration**: Temporary allowlist entry if immediate fix unavailable
4. **Emergency Bypass**: Use `[skip security]` commit message only when approved by security lead

#### Step 4: Resolution and Validation (Target: 24-72 hours)
1. **Fix Implementation**:
   - Apply security patches or dependency updates
   - Implement code changes to address application vulnerabilities
   - Update configuration or infrastructure as needed

2. **Testing and Validation**:
   - Verify fix effectiveness through automated and manual testing
   - Confirm no regression or new vulnerabilities introduced
   - Validate CI pipeline security checks pass

3. **Documentation Updates**:
   - Update security documentation if procedures change
   - Document lessons learned and preventive measures
   - Update allowlist with any temporary approvals

### Standard Response (Medium & Low Severity)

#### Medium Severity (7-day SLA)
1. **Planning**: Include in next sprint planning cycle
2. **Prioritization**: Balance with feature development based on risk assessment
3. **Implementation**: Follow standard development workflow with security review
4. **Monitoring**: Track in security dashboard until resolution

#### Low Severity (30-day SLA)
1. **Backlog Management**: Add to security backlog for future sprints
2. **Dependency Strategy**: Address during regular dependency update cycles
3. **Documentation**: Ensure vulnerability is tracked and not forgotten

## Allowlist Management

### Purpose and Scope
The allowlist mechanism provides temporary approval for known vulnerabilities when:
- No fix is immediately available from upstream maintainers
- The vulnerability has been assessed as low risk in our specific context
- A fix would introduce breaking changes requiring extended testing

### Allowlist Entry Structure
```javascript
{
  id: 'vulnerability-id-or-cve',
  reason: 'Detailed justification for allowlist inclusion',
  expires: 'YYYY-MM-DD',
  approvedBy: 'security-team-member',
  reviewDate: 'YYYY-MM-DD'
}
```

### Management Procedures

#### Adding to Allowlist
1. **Justification Required**: Document specific reasons and risk assessment
2. **Time-Limited**: All entries must have expiration dates (max 90 days)
3. **Security Team Approval**: Required for Critical/High severity allowlist entries
4. **Regular Review**: Monthly review of all allowlist entries

#### Removing from Allowlist
1. **Automatic Expiration**: Entries automatically expire on specified date
2. **Fix Available**: Remove when upstream fix becomes available
3. **Risk Reassessment**: Remove if risk profile changes

## Emergency Procedures

### Emergency Bypass
For critical production issues where security checks must be temporarily bypassed:

#### Authorization Process
1. **Security Lead Approval**: Required for all emergency bypasses
2. **Documentation**: Detailed justification and risk assessment
3. **Time Limit**: Maximum 24-hour bypass window
4. **Follow-up**: Mandatory security review within 48 hours

#### Usage
Include `[skip security]` in commit message to bypass CI security checks:
```
fix: emergency patch for critical production issue [skip security]

Bypassing security checks due to critical production outage.
Security review scheduled for next business day.

Approved-by: security-lead@company.com
Ticket: INCIDENT-2024-001
```

### Incident Escalation

#### Internal Escalation
1. **Security Team Lead** â†’ **Engineering Manager** â†’ **CTO**
2. **Time Triggers**: Automatic escalation if SLA targets missed
3. **Communication**: Regular status updates to stakeholders

#### External Escalation
1. **Customer Notification**: For Critical vulnerabilities affecting user data
2. **Regulatory Reporting**: As required by applicable regulations
3. **Public Disclosure**: Following responsible disclosure timeline

## Reporting and Communication

### Vulnerability Reporting
