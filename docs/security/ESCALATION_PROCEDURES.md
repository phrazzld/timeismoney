# Security Escalation Procedures

This document defines the escalation procedures for security vulnerabilities, incidents, and decision-making within the TimeIsMoney Chrome extension project. It establishes clear chains of authority, communication protocols, and response timelines for various security scenarios.

## Overview

Our escalation framework ensures that security issues receive appropriate attention and resources based on their severity and impact. The procedures balance rapid response for critical issues with structured decision-making for complex situations that require coordination across multiple stakeholders.

## Escalation Levels and Timeframes

### Level 1: Team Response
**Timeframe**: Immediate detection to initial response
**Authority**: Development Team, Security Team Members
**Scope**: Technical assessment, immediate containment, initial investigation

### Level 2: Management Response  
**Timeframe**: 1-4 hours for Critical, 4-24 hours for High severity
**Authority**: Security Team Lead, Engineering Manager
**Scope**: Resource allocation, cross-team coordination, business impact assessment

### Level 3: Executive Response
**Timeframe**: 4-8 hours for Critical, 24-48 hours for High severity  
**Authority**: CTO, VP Engineering, Executive Team
**Scope**: Strategic decisions, customer communication, regulatory reporting

### Level 4: External Response
**Timeframe**: 8-24 hours for Critical, 48-72 hours for High severity
**Authority**: Legal, Compliance, Public Relations
**Scope**: External communications, regulatory notifications, public disclosure

## Severity-Based Escalation Workflows

### Critical Severity (CVSS 9.0-10.0)
*Immediate threat, remotely exploitable without authentication*

#### Immediate Response (0-1 hour)
1. **Automatic Detection**: CI pipeline blocks deployment
2. **Team Notification**: Immediate Slack alert to security channel
3. **Initial Assessment**: On-call engineer confirms vulnerability
4. **Stakeholder Alert**: Security team lead and engineering manager notified

#### Level 1 Escalation (1-2 hours)
- **Trigger**: Critical vulnerability confirmed with active exploitation potential
- **Authority**: Security Team Lead
- **Actions**:
  - Activate incident response team
  - Begin technical mitigation efforts
  - Assess blast radius and user impact
  - Implement emergency containment measures

#### Level 2 Escalation (2-4 hours)
- **Trigger**: Mitigation not immediately available OR significant user impact
- **Authority**: Engineering Manager → CTO
- **Actions**:
  - Resource reallocation to security response
  - Cross-functional team activation
  - Initial customer impact assessment
  - Preparation for potential customer notification

#### Level 3 Escalation (4-8 hours)
- **Trigger**: Extended incident duration OR customer data exposure
- **Authority**: CTO → Executive Team
- **Actions**:
  - Executive incident response activation
  - Legal and compliance team involvement
  - Public relations team standby
  - Regulatory notification assessment

### High Severity (CVSS 7.0-8.9)
*Significant impact, likely exploitable with minimal conditions*

#### Initial Response (0-4 hours)
1. **Detection**: Automated security scan identifies vulnerability
2. **Assessment**: Security team evaluates impact and exploitability
3. **Planning**: Define mitigation strategy and timeline
4. **Communication**: Regular updates to engineering manager

#### Level 1 Escalation (4-12 hours)
- **Trigger**: No clear mitigation path OR complex fix required
- **Authority**: Security Team Lead
- **Actions**:
  - Detailed technical analysis
  - Resource planning for fix implementation
  - Risk assessment for continued operation

#### Level 2 Escalation (12-24 hours)
- **Trigger**: Fix requires significant resources OR business process changes
- **Authority**: Engineering Manager
- **Actions**:
  - Sprint planning adjustment
  - Cross-team coordination
  - Business impact evaluation

### Medium Severity (CVSS 4.0-6.9)
*Moderate impact, some conditions required for exploitation*

#### Standard Process (0-7 days)
1. **Integration**: Include in standard development workflow
2. **Planning**: Add to security backlog and sprint planning
3. **Coordination**: Regular security team review
4. **Escalation**: Only if fix blocked by external dependencies
