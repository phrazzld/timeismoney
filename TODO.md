# Badge UI Redesign Engineering Plan

**Philosophy: Ship fast, iterate, refactor elegant**

## SPRINT 0 (24 hours) - PROOF OF CONCEPT üöÄ

_Goal: Get a badge rendering SOMEWHERE to build confidence_

- [x] **S0.1 - Quick Win: Hardcoded badge in DOM** ‚ö°

  - Action: Add a hardcoded badge element directly in `domModifier.js` - just HTML + inline styles
  - Success: Can see a badge render on ANY website when price detected
  - Time: 2 hours
  - No dependencies, no design tokens, just SHIP SOMETHING

- [x] **S0.2 - Basic clock icon** ‚ö°

  - Action: Find any clock SVG, embed as data URI, slap it in the badge
  - Success: Badge has a clock icon (ugly is fine)
  - Time: 1 hour

- [x] **S0.3 - Manual test on Amazon** ‚ö°
  - Action: Load extension, visit Amazon, see if badges appear
  - Success: Can screenshot working badge on real site
  - Time: 30 minutes
  - **RESULT**: Major UX issues identified - badges too long, layout breaking, visual clutter

## üîÑ SPRINT 0.5 (4 hours) - UX REDESIGN BASED ON REAL USAGE üéØ

_Goal: Fix critical UX issues discovered in manual testing_

**Key Insights from Amazon Testing:**

- Current badges are 2-3x longer than original prices ‚Üí layout breaks, text cuts off
- Showing both prices simultaneously creates visual clutter and cognitive overload
- Clock icon placement is illogical (between prices vs. with time)
- "0h 15m" format is unnecessarily verbose when hours are zero
- Blue badge background conflicts with host site design systems

**New Strategy: Replace + Tooltip Approach**

- Replace price entirely with clean time conversion, show original in tooltip
- Dramatically shorter, integrates better with existing layouts
- More professional appearance, less intrusive to site design

- [x] **S0.5.1 - Implement replace-only strategy** üîß

  - Action: Replace crossed-out price + badge with clean time-only display
  - Format: `üïê 3h 15m` or `üïê 15m` (omit hours when zero)
  - Success: Much shorter replacement that doesn't break layouts
  - Time: 2 hours

- [x] **S0.5.2 - Add tooltip with original price** üí°

  - Action: Show original price in tooltip on hover: "Originally $30.00"
  - Use browser native tooltip or simple positioned div
  - Success: Original price discoverable but not cluttering display
  - Time: 1.5 hours

- [x] **S0.5.3 - Refine styling for host site integration** ‚ú®
  - Action: Remove blue badge background, use subtle styling that integrates better
  - Match host site text colors, use minimal visual distinction
  - Success: Conversions look native to the site rather than injected
  - Time: 30 minutes

## SPRINT 1 (2-3 days) - FUNCTIONAL MVP üéØ

_Goal: End-to-end working system, ugly but functional_

- [x] **S1.1 - Extract badge creation function**

  - Action: Move hardcoded badge logic into `createBadge(originalPrice, convertedHours)` function
  - Success: Clean separation, easier to iterate
  - Time: 1 hour

- [x] **S1.2 - Basic CSS-in-JS styling**

  - Action: Generate inline styles programmatically, basic color/spacing constants
  - Success: Badge looks intentional, not broken
  - Time: 3 hours

- [x] **S1.3 - Integrate with price detection flow**

  - Action: Replace text modification in `domModifier.js` with badge creation
  - Success: All detected prices become badges automatically
  - Time: 4 hours

- [x] **S1.4 - Cleanup on removal**

  - Action: Track badge elements, remove when original price removed
  - Success: No orphaned badges, no memory leaks
  - Time: 2 hours

- [x] **S1.5 - Test on 3 major sites**
  - Action: Manual test on Amazon, eBay, general e-commerce
  - Success: Screenshots of working badges, note any major issues
  - Time: 1 hour

## SPRINT 2 (2-3 days) - POLISH & EDGE CASES ‚ú®

_Goal: Looks professional, handles edge cases gracefully_

- [x] **S2.1 - Proper badge component class**

  - Action: Refactor into `PriceBadge` class with constructor/render/destroy
  - Success: Clean OOP design, easier to extend
  - Time: 3 hours

- [x] **S2.2 - Dynamic theme adaptation**

  - Action: Detect background color, adjust badge colors for contrast
  - Success: Badge readable on light/dark backgrounds
  - Time: 4 hours

- [x] **S2.3 - Responsive design**

  - Action: Badge scales properly on mobile, different viewport sizes
  - Success: Looks good on phone/desktop
  - Time: 2 hours

- [x] **S2.4 - Nice clock icon**

  - Action: Create/find proper optimized SVG, color inheritance
  - Success: Professional-looking icon, scales well
  - Time: 2 hours

- [x] **S2.5 - Style conflict prevention**
  - Action: Use unique class names, CSS specificity, maybe Shadow DOM attempt
  - Success: Badge unaffected by host site styles
  - Time: 3 hours

## SPRINT 3 (2-3 days) - PRODUCTION READY üö¢

_Goal: Ship-quality code with tests and performance_

- [x] **S3.1 - Basic accessibility**

  - Action: Add ARIA labels, screen reader friendly text
  - Success: Passes basic accessibility audit
  - Time: 2 hours

- [x] **S3.2 - Performance optimization**

  - Action: Style caching, avoid DOM thrashing, measure performance
  - Success: No noticeable performance impact
  - Time: 3 hours

- [x] **S3.3 - Unit tests**

  - Action: Test badge component creation, styling, cleanup
  - Success: Core functionality covered by tests
  - Time: 4 hours

- [x] **S3.4 - Integration tests**

  - Action: Test end-to-end price detection ‚Üí badge creation flow
  - Success: Regression protection for core user journey

## CRITICAL: CI/CD PIPELINE FAILURES üö®

**Status**: BLOCKING MERGE - All failures must be resolved before merging to master

**Categories**: 40 test failures across multiple test suites

### PRIORITY 1: Badge Display Mode Consistency Issues üî•

**Root Cause**: Tests expect backward-compatible format but get modern hover toggle format

- [ ] **T1.1**: Fix unit test badge display expectations in `PriceBadge.vitest.test.js`

  - File: `src/__tests__/components/PriceBadge.vitest.test.js`
  - Issue: Tests expect `'3h 0m'` but get `'$30.00 (3h 0m)'`
  - Action: Update tests to properly handle `enableHoverToggle` configuration
  - Lines: Icon toggle tests expecting time-only display

- [ ] **T1.2**: Fix DOM conversion integration test expectations

  - File: `src/__tests__/integration/content/dom-conversion.vitest.test.js`
  - Issue: Tests expect prices in textContent but get time-only with whitespace
  - Action: Use `.trim()` and expect time-only format or configure tests for legacy mode
  - Error: `expected 'Price: \n $199.99' to contain '$199.99'`

- [ ] **T1.3**: Audit all component tests for badge format assumptions
  - Files: Multiple component test files
  - Issue: Inconsistent expectations about badge content format
  - Action: Systematically review and fix all badge content assertions

### PRIORITY 1: Async Test Issues üî•

**Root Cause**: Tests not properly awaiting async `destroy()` method

- [ ] **T2.1**: Fix PriceBadge destroy method test patterns

  - File: `src/__tests__/components/PriceBadge.vitest.test.js`
  - Issue: `expected Promise{‚Ä¶} to be true` - tests calling async method synchronously
  - Action: Add `await` to all `badge.destroy()` calls in tests
  - Count: 3 failing tests in Destroy Method section

- [ ] **T2.2**: Audit all tests calling async badge methods
  - Files: All badge-related test files
  - Issue: Potential other async methods not being awaited
  - Action: Search for `.destroy()`, `.update()` calls and ensure proper async handling

### PRIORITY 2: Icon Design Mismatch Issues üé®

**Root Cause**: Tests expect specific SVG elements that don't match current implementation

- [ ] **T3.1**: Update icon unit tests to match current SVG design

  - File: `src/__tests__/unit/components/PriceBadge.icon.unit.vitest.test.js`
  - Issues:
    - Expected `r="0.8"` not found (circle radius changed)
    - Expected `stroke-linejoin="round"` not found (SVG attributes changed)
    - Expected `L6.2 5.8` not found (clock hand coordinates changed)
  - Action: Update test expectations to match current clock icon SVG

- [ ] **T3.2**: Verify icon design requirements vs implementation
  - File: Current SVG in `src/components/PriceBadge.js:_createClockIcon()`
  - Issue: Tests suggest different design requirements than implemented
  - Action: Decide if tests should match implementation or implementation should match tests

### PRIORITY 2: Style Generation Issues üé®

**Root Cause**: Defensive styling generates complex CSS that doesn't contain expected simple properties

- [ ] **T4.1**: Fix dark theme style detection test

  - File: `src/__tests__/unit/utils/styleGenerator.unit.vitest.test.js`
  - Issue: Expected `color: #10b981` not found in complex defensive CSS string
  - Current: `text-transform: none; letter-spacing: normal; word-spacing: normal; ... color: #059669 !important; ...`
  - Action: Either update test to check for actual applied color or fix theme detection

- [ ] **T4.2**: Fix responsive font-size detection test

  - File: `src/__tests__/unit/utils/styleGenerator.responsive.unit.vitest.test.js`
  - Issue: Expected `font-size: 0.875rem` not found in defensive CSS
  - Action: Update test to extract actual font-size from complex CSS string

- [ ] **T4.3**: Create CSS property extraction helper for tests
  - Issue: Multiple tests expect simple properties in complex defensive CSS
  - Action: Create test utility to extract specific CSS properties from defensive style strings

### PRIORITY 2: Responsive Sizing Issues üì±

**Root Cause**: Tablet sizes equal desktop sizes instead of being between mobile and desktop

- [ ] **T5.1**: Fix tablet sizing to be between mobile and desktop

  - File: `src/__tests__/unit/utils/styleGenerator.responsive.simple.unit.vitest.test.js`
  - Issue: `expected 0.75 to be less than 0.75` - tablet size equals desktop size
  - Action: Review responsive size calculation logic to ensure proper scaling

- [ ] **T5.2**: Fix error handling size fallback
  - Same file as T5.1
  - Issue: `expected '0.875rem' to be '0.75rem'` - wrong fallback size
  - Action: Update fallback size logic for invalid size keys

### PRIORITY 3: Settings Manager Error Handling üîß

**Root Cause**: Spy call count expectations don't match actual behavior

- [ ] **T6.1**: Fix settings manager error handling test
  - File: `src/__tests__/integration/content/settingsManager.error.vitest.test.js`
  - Issue: `expected "spy" to be called +0 times, but got 1 times`
  - Action: Review visibility change error handling logic and update test expectations

### PRIORITY 3: Responsive Context Issues üìê

**Root Cause**: Test expectations about responsive context don't match implementation

- [ ] **T7.1**: Fix responsive context default behavior test
  - File: `src/__tests__/unit/utils/styleGenerator.responsive.unit.vitest.test.js`
  - Issue: `expected true to be false` - responsive context enabled by default
  - Action: Review responsive context creation logic and update test

### CROSS-CUTTING TASKS üîÑ

- [ ] **T8.1**: Audit all tests for `.textContent` vs `.textContent.trim()`

  - Issue: SVG whitespace causing textContent mismatches across multiple tests
  - Action: Systematically add `.trim()` where needed for badge content tests

- [ ] **T8.2**: Create badge test utilities for consistent expectations

  - Issue: Inconsistent badge content testing patterns across files
  - Action: Create helper functions for common badge assertion patterns

- [ ] **T8.3**: Document badge display mode test strategies
  - Issue: Tests unclear about when to expect modern vs legacy format
  - Action: Create testing guide for badge display mode configurations

## ANTI-PATTERNS TO AVOID ‚ö†Ô∏è

- ‚ùå Waiting for perfect design before coding
- ‚ùå Building test infrastructure before feature
- ‚ùå Optimizing before measuring performance problems
- ‚ùå Adding complexity that doesn't serve users
- ‚ùå Perfectionism blocking iteration
- ‚ùå **Skipping real-world testing** (Sprint 0 taught us our badge approach broke layouts)
- ‚ùå **Showing too much information simultaneously** (original + converted prices created clutter)
- ‚ùå **Changing test expectations to match bugs** (Fix implementation, not tests)
- ‚ùå **Ignoring CI failures** (All tests must pass before merge)
