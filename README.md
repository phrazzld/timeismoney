## Technical Architecture üèóÔ∏è

### Multi-Pass Detection Pipeline

The enhanced price detection system uses a sophisticated multi-pass approach:

1. **Pass 1**: Site-specific handlers (highest confidence)
2. **Pass 2**: DOM attribute extraction (aria-label, data-\*)
3. **Pass 3**: DOM structure analysis (split components)
4. **Pass 4**: Enhanced pattern matching on extracted text
5. **Pass 5**: Contextual patterns ("Under $X", "from $X")

### Core Components

- **`priceExtractor.js`**: Unified extraction pipeline with strategy coordination
- **`domPriceAnalyzer.js`**: DOM structure analysis and attribute extraction
- **`siteHandlers.js`**: Site-specific optimization for major e-commerce platforms
- **`pricePatterns.js`**: Advanced pattern library for diverse price formats

### Pattern Configuration

The system supports flexible pattern configuration through:

- **Text Patterns**: Regular expression-based matching for standard formats
- **DOM Patterns**: Structure-aware extraction from complex HTML layouts
- **Site Handlers**: Custom logic for specific website requirements
- **Contextual Patterns**: Understanding of pricing context and terminology
