# T016 Plan - Add "type": "module" to package.json

## Task Details
- **ID:** T016
- **Type:** Refactor
- **Priority:** P1
- **Context:** cr-16, Step 1
- **Status:** In Progress

## Current State Analysis
The codebase is transitioning to ES6 modules but currently doesn't have `"type": "module"` set in package.json. This means Node.js treats .js files as CommonJS modules by default.

## Plan
1. Review the current package.json file
2. Add `"type": "module"` to the root level of package.json
3. Verify the change doesn't break existing scripts or builds
4. Commit the change

## Considerations
- This change will impact how Node.js interprets .js files (as ES6 modules rather than CommonJS by default)
- It's the first step in a multi-step process to fully adopt ES6 modules across the codebase
- Subsequent tasks (T017, T018) will update build configs and tests to use ES6 module syntax

## Risks
- Potential to break scripts that rely on CommonJS module semantics
- Build scripts and testing infrastructure may need additional updates

## Implementation
1. Add the `"type": "module"` property to package.json
2. Run key npm scripts to verify functionality

## Testing
- Run `npm run build` to verify the build process still works
- Basic sanity check of package.json syntax

## Completion Criteria
- package.json contains `"type": "module"`
- Node treats JS files as ES6 modules by default
