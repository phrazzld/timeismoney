# Plan for Documenting Vitest Patterns

## Document Purpose

Create a guide that establishes the preferred patterns for writing new tests using Vitest in the Time Is Money extension. The document will serve as a reference for developers to ensure consistent test structure, organization, and best practices across the codebase.

## Document Structure

1. Introduction

   - Purpose of the document
   - How to use the guide

2. File Structure and Organization

   - Naming conventions
   - Directory organization
   - When to create different types of tests (unit, integration, DOM)

3. Basic Test Structure

   - Required imports
   - Setup and teardown patterns
   - Test and describe block organization
   - Testing patterns for different component types

4. Mocking Patterns

   - How to mock Chrome APIs
   - External module mocking
   - When to use spies vs. mocks

5. Asynchronous Testing

   - Handling promises
   - Testing async/await functions
   - Best practices for avoiding flaky tests

6. Data Setup Patterns

   - Setting up test data
   - Common test fixtures
   - Avoiding test data duplication

7. Assertions and Expectations

   - Common assertion patterns
   - Testing DOM elements and events
   - Testing error cases

8. Performance Considerations

   - Keeping tests fast
   - Avoiding unnecessary test setup
   - Efficient test organization

9. Examples
   - Complete examples from the codebase
   - Specific patterns for common testing scenarios
   - Before and after examples showing preferred patterns

## Implementation Approach

1. **Review Existing Vitest Files**

   - Analyze structure of existing migrated files
   - Identify common patterns and best practices
   - Note any anti-patterns to avoid

2. **Consult Vitest Documentation**

   - Review official Vitest best practices
   - Incorporate relevant patterns from Vitest docs
   - Ensure alignment with latest Vitest features

3. **Create Comprehensive Document**

   - Write clear, concise guidelines
   - Include code examples from our own codebase
   - Focus on practical, real-world examples

4. **Validate with Real Examples**
   - Test the guidelines against actual test requirements
   - Ensure the patterns work well with our project structure
   - Adjust as needed based on practical application

## Output Format

Create a Markdown document named `VITEST-PATTERNS.md` in the project root directory, following the structure above, with a focus on practical examples and clear guidelines.
